## Ambiguity

There is ambiguity in how the Atlas edits be made. It says at any time but should specify that these edits should be proposed at the next weekly governance poll. It also omits any discussion that might take place regarding the edits. Should the governance facilitators make a forum post suggesting alternative wordings to an Atlas section before moving it to a poll? This could help nail down the exact wording before proceeding with a poll. 

It also does not address a situation where there is a live poll that contains a misunderstanding. Should this poll be immediately removed and replaced with a new poll to decide on the interpretation or should the poll continue and the new interpretation poll follow the next week?

However, there must be some level of ambiguity in these clauses as they serve as somewhat of a catch-all for unintended consequences or mistakes in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts. If these clauses are too specific it could result in a situation where the Atlas could be misused with no recourse for fixing the mistakes. It is important to clearly define the process involved in fixing mistakes while still allowing some ambiguity on the circumstances to allow unforeseen circumstances to be fixed

## Rewrite

**12.1: Bootstrapping Governance Votes** 

Governance Facilitators are empowered to use broad judgment when exercising their ability to make direct Atlas interpretations and edits to the Atlas and the Scope Artifacts, when this relates to unintended consequences or mistakes in the affected documents.

**12.1.1:**
In case of unintended consequences or mistakes in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts causing Maker Governance to function incorrectly, the Governance Facilitators can run a Governance Poll in the next weekly polling cycle to enable MKR holders to make a decision on Atlas interpretation that will alleviate and resolve unintended consequences or mistakes.

**12.1.2:** 
Any upcoming poll that results in disagreement regarding the true meaning of the Atlas should be postponed until The Governance Facilitators can create a poll to allow MKR to decide on the correct Atlas interpretation.

**12.2.2:** 
The Governance Facilitators can at any time propose to edit any content of a Scope Artifact through Governance Poll in the next weekly cycle. The Governance Facilitators should clearly communicate their intended edits beforehand to prompt discussion on what the correct wording should be to avoid multiple polls being needed.

## Situation Interpretation

**Situation A**

Under these circumstances, it is clearly in the Governance Facilitators rights to propose an edit to the governance scope given this is an ` unintended consequence or mistake `

I would respond by making a post clearly pointing out the typo and communicating my plans on remedying this. I would include the proposed fix to this typo and create a Poll to accept the fix to the typo. Once the poll is passed the Atlas would be changed to fix the typo and allow the ADs to be compensated. 

**Situation B**

My interpretation of the clauses would be that this does not immediately qualify as something that would require an edit or interpretation ruling.

I would find out more about the situation to discover if there was a real possibility of the DAO losing significant value. If there is a significant concern from not only the token holder but the larger community I would create a poll to determine if MKR holders believed a change was necessary. If this poll passed I would then draft the necessary edits and put this to a poll.

**Situation C**

I would follow the same procedures as in situation B. While being a large MKR holder may provide the initial concern more credibility this is not necessarily true. Regardless more information would need to be gathered before proceeding with the actions mentioned in situation B.

**Situation D**

This situation does not seem to fit into the mentioned clauses as there is no mistake or misuse in this scenario. However, some action would need to be taken as AD are a vital part of the community. I would hope that discussions would ensue and lead to the community wanting a new poll and following executive vote that would increase AD compensation in hopes that the ADs would return.
