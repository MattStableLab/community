# StableLab Poll Excercise 02

## My Course of Action as a Governance Facilitator:

I would reply to Clive’s response to explain why Diane’s previously posted materials constitute reasonable suspicion. I would also point out that Atlas section 2.6.6.1 clearly states, "FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the privacy of an AD is compromised.” Since this constitutes a “real possibility” I must act and create a poll to decide if these materials constitute “significant suspicion” as mentioned in Atlas section 2.6.6. I would also mention that I plan to include the poll in the next weekly governance cycle and include the potential start date of the poll.

I would then respond to Diane and make it clear that unless other materials proving Clive’s identity are provided before the poll I will include in the Outcomes section of the poll that half of Clive’s AD Buffer would be awarded to Diane as a whistleblower bounty if the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option.

I would continue monitoring any additional evidence provided privately and determine if there was any concrete evidence that Clive’s identity is compromised. If there were, I would cancel the poll, immediately derecognize Clive, and communicate with the community that new evidence has emerged causing Clive to be derecognized and that there will no longer be a poll.

I would then draft the poll using the $GenericBinary - $date_MONTH_DD,_YYYY.md template. I would review the poll to ensure it met all specifications mentioned in the poll-review checklist. After creating a PR to add this poll I would wait until the poll became active and communicate in the #governance channel of the MakerDao Discord server being sure to @community and including the link to the active polls.

### Response to Clive

Clive,

While the materials Diane’s are not concrete evidence they do constitute reasonable suspicion.

Atlas section 2.6.6.1 clearly states 

> FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act in case there is any kind of real possibility that the privacy of an AD is compromised.

Since this constitutes a “real possibility” I must act and create a poll to let the voter decide on this matter. I plan to include the poll in the next weekly governance cycle on Monday, August 14, 2023. 

### Response to Diane

Diane,

Atlas section 2.6.6 states:
> Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised.

I will include in the Outcomes section of the poll that half of Clive’s AD Buffer will be awarded to you as a whistleblower bounty if the 'Yes' option exceeds the votes for the 'No' option. Your reward would then be included in the next round of AD payouts.
