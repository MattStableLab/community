## My Course of Action as a Governance Facilitator:

I would first create the poll since this is a time-sensitive situation. This poll will allow the community to signal if they want to include an executive vote for Fix A. Once the poll was live I would alert everyone in the discord channel with a link to the poll.

I would then respond to Genevieve, Henrik, and Imogen to explain that I have posted the poll Imogen requested to allow the community to decide on the inclusion of Fix A. I would also respond to Genevieve to inform her she should let Henrik sign off on the executive spells since Henrik and Roundtable will be the team coordinating the technical response. However, I would warn Henrik not to delay too long and that if the poll votes in favor of the inclusion of Fix A he must not delay the Fix A executive spell just because they are personally against it. 

I would then continue to monitor the situation and stay in contact with Genevieve, Henrik, and Imogen to see if there were more developments concerning the exploit that would warrant different actions.



## Forum Responses

@Imogen thanks for bringing this to my attention. I have created [a poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) to allow the community to signal if they want to include an executive vote for Fix A.

@Genevieve please allow Henrik to quickly sign off on the executive spells you are creating given his team will be coordinating the technical response.

@Henrik I understand your preference in the course of action but we must let the community decide whether Fix A will be included for an executive vote. You may sign off on the executive spells but do not delay any further than necessary. You must also obey the poll results and not block or delay the Fix A executive spell if the poll passes.
