# Poll: Clive Derecognition as AD - August 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system. This Governance Poll will be active for three days beginning on 8, August 2023 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:

* Derecognition of Clive AD due to significant suspicion of identity discovery. According to the Atlas, if the materials provided against Clive constitute significant suspicion the aligned delegate must be derecognized.
* AD Diane is acting as a whistle-blower by providing materials suggesting the identity of Clive. According to Atlas, Diane is eligible to receive half of the AD Buffer for providing useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised. 

Please review the discussion [thread](discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
