# Poll: Response Plan for Exploit - August 14, 2023

The governance facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of Protocol Scope Facilitator Imogen. This Governance Poll will be active for three days beginning on August 14, 2023, at 16:00 UTC.

**This is an approval vote to select a single winning outcome.**
- **You may vote for multiple options.**
- **You should select all the options that you would support in an executive vote.**
- **Unselected options signal that you do not approve of those options and would not support the option(s) in an executive vote.**
- **If you wish to abstain, that should be your one and only choice.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following changes:
 * Move Forward with Fix A to address to exploit in a core Maker Protocol contract
    * Fix A prevents the high-severity exploit immediately upon the executive vote passing.
    * Fix A is likely to incur losses to MKR holders of approximately 20 million DAI over two weeks.
* Move Forward with Fix A to address to exploit in a core Maker Protocol contract
    * Fix B closes the high-severity exploit approximately two weeks after the executive vote passes.
    * Fix B has no risk of incurring financial loss to MKR holders.

Please review the discussion [thread](discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**The non-'Abstain' option with the most votes is deemed the winner, if it represents a change from the status quo the following actions will be taken:**
* The voted-on Fix will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place shortly given the immediacy of the issue.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired.
